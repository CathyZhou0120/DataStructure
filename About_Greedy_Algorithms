When implementing greedy algorithms, you should pay attention to:

1. safe move
2. prove safety
3. solve subproblem
4. estimate running time

For safe moves:
1. Put max digit first
2. Find first occurrence of the first character
3. Cover leftmost point 
4. Use item with maximum value per unit of weight 

Optimization:
1. Assume everything is somewhat sorted
2. Which sort order is convenient?
3. Greedy move can be faster after sorting 

General Strategy
1. understand the problem
2. make a greedy choice
3. prove that it is a safe move
4. reduce problem to subproblem
